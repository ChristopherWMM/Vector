### - About Vector

Vector is a timed runner built in Unity for the Reuben H. Fleet Science Center as part of their Game Masters exhibit and “Genius in the House” program to demonstrate the Tobii Eye Tracker. Players are tasked with going through alternating colors to increase their speed and finish as fast as they can! I was tasked with showing my game to the guests, have discussions about game development, and answer their questions about my personal experiences.

### - Accessability

My mentor for the Reuben H. Fleet Science Center presentation, Jeffrey Yee, is color blind. During our testing period, it became apparent that I really needed to take this into account seeing as though my game requires players to rapidly distinguish colors apart from one another. Keeping with the theme of visual-based alternative controller schemes, I wanted to make my game as accessible as possible. To do this, I chose specific colors and textures that would allow for *most* types of color blindness accessibility. Here is what the game would look like:

![vector][vector-image]

#### - Protanopia *(Red/green color blindness; Anomalous red cones)*

#### - Deutanopia *(Red/green color blindness; Anomalous green cones)*
![vector-image-deutanopia][vector-image-deutanopia]
  
#### - Tritanopia *(Blue/yellow color blindness; Anomalous blue cones)*

As you can see, the difference between colors is still quite recognizable.

"Genius in the House" is a casual event in the exhibit galleries, not a lecture, that brings brainiacs from fields such as biology, art, engineering, mathematics and more to the Fleet to enhance the exhibit experience. Visitors are able to chat with the genius, ask questions, and explore themes from our exhibitions in ways that are both "insightful and delightful".

The Tobii EyeX is a powerful gaming eye tracker that provides entirely new game experiences by allowing gamers to communicate with their PCs, using their eyes. In the image above, the white blob represents my visual focus.

It is honestly amazing to be able to play a game, let alone write one, utilizing this breathtaking technology.

Below is a visual of the device itself, in order to use it you simply need to place it on the top or bottom of the display. More information as well as the development sdk can be found on their website [https://tobiigaming.com/product/tobii-eyex/](https://tobiigaming.com/product/tobii-eyex/).
